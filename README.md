# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_MS_EXCEL_CUSTOMER_CREDIT_CARD_DATA
As part of a group project from UNP Education, we analyzed credit card customer data.
We started by cleaning and filtering the raw Excel dataset for consistency and clarity.
Unnecessary columns and null values were removed to improve data quality.
With the cleaned dataset, we created pivot tables to extract meaningful metrics.
Pivot charts were then generated to help visualize spending patterns and trends.
The project focused on customer segmentation and behavioral insights.
It highlights core skills in data cleaning, Excel functions, and visualÂ reporting.
